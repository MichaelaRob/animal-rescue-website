        <h3 class="push-half">Why do we love rabbits?</h3>
        <p>We are obsessed with taking care of rabbits. Their fluffy tails, long whiskers, and long, sometimes floppy ears. Rabbits are extremely social creatures that normally live in large groups referred to as colonies. Rabbits are very clean pets to have and are extremely easy to house train. Rabbits understand when their names are called and may be trained to perform simple tricks much like dogs. Fun fact, rabbits are most similar to horses! Both of their eyes can roll around 360 degrees, their teeth never stop growing and their ears have many similarities and neither can throw up!</p>
